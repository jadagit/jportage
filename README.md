# jportage

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg)

## Overview

**jportage** is a command-line tool for managing Gentoo Linux Portage and performing common administrative tasks. It provides an easy-to-use menu-driven interface for syncing the Portage tree, updating the system, creating backups, enabling debugging, and configuring compression. **jportage** is designed to simplify Gentoo system administration and is highly extensible for future development.

## Project Development Model

This project follows an open-source and community-driven development model. Contributions are welcome from the community, and discussions about the project occur on the GitHub repository's [Issues](https://github.com/jadagit/jportage/issues) page.

## Requirements

- Gentoo Linux
- Portage utilities (emerge, equery, etc.)
- Dialog package for the menu interface

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jadagit/jportage.git`
2. Run the script as a superuser using sudo: `sudo ./jportage.sh`
   - Running `./jportage.sh` as a user should provide usage or prompt for sudo.
  
To use **jportage**, you can run it from the command line with various options. Here are (some of) the available options:

- `-s, --sync`: Sync and update the Portage system.
- `-b, --backup`: Create a backup of your system.
- `-d, --debug`: Enable debugging mode.
- `-c, --compression`: Configure compression settings.
- `-h, --help`: Display the help.

### Menu Options

- **Sync and Update:** Sync the Portage tree and update the system.
- **Create Backup:** Create backups of specific files or directories.
- **Enable Debugging:** Enable debugging by setting 'set -x', and/or native portage debug.
- **Configure Compression:** Configure compression options (zstd, xz, gzip, bzip2).
- **Exit:** Quit the script.

### Configuration

You can create a configuration file (`/etc/j.config`) to customize your settings.


### Prerequisites

To use **jportage**, you need to ensure that the required prerequisite packages are installed on your system. The script checks for these prerequisites and offers to install them if they are missing.

- `dialog`: A tool for creating text-based user interfaces.
- `app-portage/portage-utils`: Required utilities for Portage.
- `other-other/others-misc`


## Future Development

The power of **jportage** lies in its extensibility. Future development efforts will focus on expanding functionality through the addition of custom hooks. These hooks will enable you to tailor the script to your specific requirements or integrate it with other Gentoo utilities.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Join the community in shaping the future of Gentoo administration with **jportage**.
